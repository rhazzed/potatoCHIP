# getLidar - Pickup lidar readings from /dev/shm/??? files and put them into "lidar.csv" file

# HISTORICAL INFORMATION -
#
#  2021-02-10  msipin  Added VERBOSE flag, and turned it off by default
#  2021-02-22  msipin  Delayed modifying lidar.csv until the last moment to prevent the plot tool
#                      from seeing an empty file during this script's calculations.
