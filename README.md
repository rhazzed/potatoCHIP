# Raspberry Pi 3B+ code development for Derpa and Nimrod
  (We originally used a C.H.I.P. single board computer, so you may see remnants of that in the codebase...)

Both are tracked robots based on the OSEPP TANK-01 (https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/osepp-electronics-ltd/TANK-01/11198516).

This is a (mostly) Python codebase to get various things going with -- like a 16-channel I2C PWM controller board, Ultrasonic Range Sensors, LIDAR, IR, Laser range finders and more.

REQUIREMENTS -

     pip install httpserver
